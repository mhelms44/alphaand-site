    <h4>About Alpha Andromeda</h4>
    <p class="lead">Do you look up at the night sky and feel homesick?
      Do you feel morose when you think about all the people you have to share this planet with?
      Perhaps you spend an unhealthy amount of time fantasizing about that Volvo station wagon
      you saw on Facebook Marketplace? Alpha Andromeda invites listeners to contemplate these topics
      as they blend tales of cosmic horror, the anguish of existence, and V8 engine swapped drift-wagons
      into an ethereal gumbo of extra spicy metal. </p>

        <p>Alpha Andromeda, based in central North Carolina, was founded in 2019. The band have played in multiple projects together since 2011, and three of the four members went to the same high school. Alpha Andromeda's main goal is to have no limitations to what can be done. No rules, just riffs is a guiding principle for the group who prioritize their vision over alignment with a specific style. The message, obscured beneath the layers of dark themes and aggressive music is ironically a positive affirmation of fun over existential dread. Alpha Andromeda embodies this message by combining foreboding ambience, intricate rhythms, and face-shredding leads soaring high during the crest before crashing down into the depths below. Following the 2019 releases of <em>Gaze Into The Void</em> and <em>Junko</em> the band released <em>A Good Rope and a Strong Branch</em> and <em>Ominous Mechanobiology</em> in 2020. The band is working on an LP with an expected release date of Q1CY23
